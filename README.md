# MDToolbar---MDNavigationDrawer---MDBottomNavigation
This code compiles the toolbar, navigation drawer and bottom navigation from KivyMD.
I created this program for a project. 
Visually, it's amazing. 
The problem I found is that the way the ScreenManager works is different from the 'normal' Kivy.
Be careful of that. 
Cheers, mates.
